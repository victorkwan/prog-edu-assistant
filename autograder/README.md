# Autograder

This directory contains a few examples of autograder scripts.
Eventually it may also contain a shared library of functions
that are useful for composing autograder tests.

* `unittest/` --- tests based on Python unittest library.

Note that the files in this directory are examples only.
The autograder scripts for production deployment will be
extracted from master assignment notebooks rather than copied
from this directory.
